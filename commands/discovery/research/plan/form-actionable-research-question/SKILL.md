# Craft actionable research question

## Purpose

Transform team goals into strong research questions that guide investigation and enable confident decision-making.

## When to use

Use this skill when:
- The team has goals but unclear learning objectives
- Discussion indicates vague needs ("more data", "user insights")
- The team has a laundry list of questions without clear direction
- Methods are proposed before establishing criteria
- You need to align research direction before planning execution

## Core approach

The skill addresses a critical distinction: teams often jump to what they want to ask before clarifying what they need to know.

### Assess team readiness

Probe the team's thinking by asking:
- What kind of answer do they expect to see?
- What will they do with the answer?
- What decision will this inform?

These questions reveal how well-formed their thinking is and whether they're prepared to act on findings.

### Understand the context

Before proposing questions, establish:
- **End goal**: What is the team trying to achieve?
- **Hypotheses**: What assumptions are they operating under?
- **Knowledge gaps**: What don't they know that prevents progress?
- **Decision criteria**: What would allow them to move forward with confidence?

### Form research questions

Develop lines of inquiry that:
- Address specific knowledge gaps
- Enable decision-making with confidence
- Guide the research approach
- Can be answered through research methods

These are _research questions_ that guide execution, not the exact questions posed to participants.

## Quality criteria

Strong research questions:
- Connect directly to team goals
- Identify specific information needs
- Have clear implications for action
- Can be answered through research
- Guide method selection rather than prescribe it

Weak signals indicating poor questions:
- "We need more data" without specificity
- Method proposed before question is clear
- Team can't articulate what they'd do with the answer
- Question is really multiple questions
- No clear decision point

## Process

1. **Contextualise** - Review outputs from stakeholder interviews, assumption workshops, or front-line collaboration to understand team goals
2. **Probe** - Ask team members about expected answers and intended actions
3. **Synthesise** - Identify end goals, hypotheses, and knowledge gaps
4. **Propose** - Draft research questions that enable confident decisions
5. **Validate** - Confirm questions align with team needs and they're prepared to act
6. **Guide** - Use questions to inform study plan or research-driven design project

## Output format

Research questions should be documented with:
- The question itself
- Team goal it addresses
- Expected decision point or action
- Knowledge gap it fills
- Success criteria (how we'll know we've answered it)
