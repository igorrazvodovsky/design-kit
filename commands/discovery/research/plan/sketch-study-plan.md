# Instructions

Consider where or how you can observe real behavior, and real context. Behavior is the strongest and most viable signal for design research, and the type of raw data that allows us to draw well-formed inferences and insights from our work. Plan backwards from there, layering in the constraints, timing, and expectations generated from the circumstances you’re working in.

Carefully plan your study's ==methods== and approach to cover the topics you need to learn about in a rigorous and viable way. Ensure in advance you will have the type of evidence you need to create the outcomes you’re aiming for. Scope your approach with a realistic sense of the time it takes to conduct research and sensemaking, and the budget you can operate with. Share and review the plan with relevant stakeholders ahead of time to generate alignment and buy-in.

As part of the planning set the conditions for defining ==Participant Segment & Screener==. Together a plan and screener enable ==Participant Recruiting & Coordination==.
