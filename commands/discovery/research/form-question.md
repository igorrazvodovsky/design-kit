understand the team’s end goal, their hypotheses, and where their gaps in knowledge lie. Propose lines of inquiry that, when answered, will allow the team to make decisions with confidence. These will not be the exact questions you pose to research participants; here, you form a strong research question to guide the approach to execution.

# Output

- Frame hypothesis: what’s the current story of what’s going on?
- Rival frames: what are 1–2 plausible alternative stories?
- System behaviour to regulate: the variable(s) you intend to nudge (e.g., loop length, recovery time, option diversity).
- Decision hook: the concrete decision this research enables next (so the team can act on the answer).
- Reframe triggers: findings that would move us to a rival frame.
