## Interviewing executives

### Who to interview

Seek executives with cross-functional authority who can balance perspectives across:
- Product strategy
- Business objectives
- Technical constraints
- Market dynamics
- Organisational capabilities

### Key questions for executives

**"What do I need to know that you don't think other members of your team have said?"**

This question:
- Surfaces strategic insights not visible at other levels
- Reveals political considerations
- Uncovers organisational dynamics
- Identifies gaps in team communication

**"If you had to choose between going to market on schedule with a flawed product, or going to market late with a solid product, which would you choose?"**

Ask this if there seems to be conflict on priorities. It reveals:
- True project priorities
- Strategic trade-offs
- What "flawed" and "solid" mean to them
- Risk tolerance

### Additional executive questions

Use marketing stakeholder questions (see checklist), plus focus on:
- Strategic decisions and product vision
- Cross-functional challenges
- Organisational constraints
- Long-term objectives

## Interviewing subject matter experts (SMEs)

### Choosing the right SMEs

**Look for experts with broad and deep industry experience**, not just anyone familiar with the domain.

**Avoid "presumed experts"** who are slightly outside their actual expertise area. They may:
- Make unfounded assumptions
- Provide misleading information
- Lack nuanced understanding

### Timing and duration

**Spend 1-2 hours getting background before conducting user interviews.**

This helps you:
- Understand domain context
- Ask better questions during user research
- Recognise when users deviate from standard practices
- Interpret what you observe

### Core SME questions

**"What are the typical demographics and skills of potential users, and how much variation in these is typical?"**

This establishes:
- User population characteristics
- Range of skill levels to account for
- How homogeneous versus diverse users are

**"What distinctions in user roles and tasks would you expect us to see?"**

This reveals:
- Different user types you should study
- Role-based workflow variations
- Task complexity differences

**"What sorts of workflows or practices do you think we'll be seeing in the field?"**

This provides:
- Expected workflow patterns
- Standard practices
- Regulatory or industry requirements
- Common approaches versus edge cases

### Interview techniques for SMEs

**Be clear that you'll rely on their detailed knowledge** - This establishes their expertise while framing your role as learner.

**Maintain a fresh perspective by asking "na√Øve questions"** - Don't assume industry norms make sense. Question the status quo:
- "Why is it done that way?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "Is that requirement or just convention?"

**Use whiteboard diagrams to explore processes** - Visual mapping helps:
- Clarify complex workflows
- Identify decision points
- Spot gaps or inefficiencies
- Build shared understanding

## Other specialised stakeholders

### QA managers

**"What problems do you currently see in development?"**

QA insights reveal:
- Engineering team strengths and weaknesses
- Common failure modes
- Testing challenges
- Quality concerns

### Support and customer service teams

**"What problems do you see most often?"**

Support teams know:
- Where users actually struggle
- Most common complaints
- Feature requests
- Misunderstandings

### Training staff and technical writers

**"Where do users most often get confused today?"**

They can identify:
- Conceptual difficulties
- Interface problems
- Documentation gaps
- Learning barriers

### Regulatory and compliance experts

For regulated industries, these experts help you understand:
- Mandatory requirements
- Compliance constraints
- Documentation needs
- Approval processes

## Balancing perspectives

Remember that SMEs and executives have valuable but partial views:
- They may not accurately represent typical users
- Their assumptions may be outdated
- Organisational politics may colour their perspective
- They see the system, not the experience

Always validate SME insights through direct user research.
