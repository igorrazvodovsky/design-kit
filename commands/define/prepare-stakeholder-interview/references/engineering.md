## Who to interview

**Engineering management and design engineers** - These are your primary engineering contacts.

**For hardware projects** - Include electrical and mechanical engineering leads.

**Avoid involving the entire engineering team** - Focus on key technical decision-makers and system architects.

## Addressing engineer scepticism

Engineers may initially be wary of designers because:
- They feel designers might step on technical territory
- They're concerned about unrealistic design requirements
- They've had negative experiences with designers who don't understand constraints

**Most engineers become cooperative once they see designers can improve solutions** without creating technical chaos.

## Key questions

### What technology decisions have already been made, and how firm are they?

This reveals:
- Fixed versus flexible constraints
- Architectural decisions already committed
- Platform choices and their rationale
- Areas where you have design freedom

**Important:** Don't frame questions as "What _can_ we do?" - This puts engineers in the position of making commitments they're not ready to make.

Instead, focus on understanding the challenges and context.

### How large is the development team assigned to the project, and what are their skills?

This helps you understand:
- Team capacity and capability
- Skill gaps that might affect design decisions
- Whether the team size matches project ambitions

**Red flag:** Mismatched team skills versus product expectations. If the team doesn't have the expertise for what's being proposed, designs may need to account for this constraint.

### Would you draw a diagram and tell me in lay terms how the system works? (existing products only)

For redesigns or enhancements, understanding the current system helps you:
- Grasp technical architecture
- Identify opportunities and constraints
- Speak more intelligently with engineers
- Avoid proposing solutions that conflict with system design

**Approach:** Ask engineers to explain in non-technical terms, using diagrams. This helps them relax and ensures you understand correctly.

## Interview techniques

### Encourage engineers to relax

Make it clear you're not asking for commitments. Frame questions around:
- Understanding context
- Learning about challenges
- Exploring possibilities

Avoid: "Can you build X?"
Better: "What would be challenging about building something like X?"

### Don't ask what you "can" and "can't" do

This framing:
- Forces premature commitment
- Creates adversarial dynamic
- Misses opportunities to explore alternatives

Instead, ask about:
- Challenges and trade-offs
- Similar things they've built before
- What would make something easier or harder

## Red flags to watch for

### Mismatched team skills

If the engineering team doesn't have the skills for what's being proposed:
- Designs may need simplification
- Timeline expectations may be unrealistic
- Additional resources may be needed

### Anxiety about technical challenges

Engineers who seem anxious about specific technical aspects may be signalling:
- Significant technical risk
- Uncertain feasibility
- Need for more research or prototyping

### Dependency on pre-existing libraries

**Warning sign:** Programmers who can't build solutions without pre-existing libraries or frameworks.

This suggests:
- Limited problem-solving capability
- Potential rigidity in implementation
- May struggle with novel design requirements

## Building collaborative relationships

The goal is to establish designers and engineers as partners solving problems together:
- Show respect for technical expertise
- Demonstrate understanding of constraints
- Focus on shared problem-solving
- Avoid "throwing designs over the wall"

Most engineers appreciate designers who:
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Understand trade-offs
- Work within realistic constraints
- Help create better solutions
