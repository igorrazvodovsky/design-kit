name: Reframing
description: Shifts semantic perspective by systematically changing the actor, the context, or the design embodiment to unlock new implications.
---

### When to use
- You’re stuck inside the “normal” frame or want to expand into unexpected areas.
- You need empathy‑driven alternatives that change constraints.

### Inputs
A current frame (who, where, what embodiment). Whiteboard or worksheet.

### Instructions
1) **Identify the normal frame** (Perspective, Environment, Embodiment).
2) **Create three blank charts** — one for each dimension.
3) **Reframe by substitution.** For each chart, list 3–5 alternates (e.g., a new audience, a new setting, a new embodiment such as service vs. product).
4) **For each alternate,** write the **primary user goal** and **design implications/constraints**.
5) **Optional:** sketch the implication to make it tangible.

### Outputs
A set of reframed scenarios with clear implications ready for concepting.

### Quality checks
Each reframed row changes at least one core constraint (not just aesthetics).

### Failure modes & mitigations
**Shallow alternates** → push for perspective, environment, _and_ embodiment shifts, not just one.
