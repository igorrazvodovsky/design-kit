name: "Flow Diagramming"
description: "Visualizes actors, communications, and artifacts across a process; use to spot friction and opportunities and to align teams around an archetypal path through a system."

### When to use
- You need to make sense of complex processes or service interactions.
- You’re looking for bottlenecks, policy constraints, or gaps in hand‑offs.

### Inputs
- Interview notes/observations, list of actors/roles, artifacts, locations.

### Instructions
1) **Choose a scope.** Early‑stage (discovery) or late‑stage (detailed task flow).
2) **Map actors & channels.** Draw people/roles as nodes; show communications as arrows (calls, emails, chats, signage).
3) **Add sequence & triggers.** Mark the order, intents, and triggers that drive transitions.
4) **Place artifacts/spaces.** Show tools, documents, screens, and physical spaces where work actually happens.
5) **Mark breakpoints.** Annotate delays, rework loops, approvals, or policy constraints.
6) **Summarize insights.** Capture 5–7 “what this means” statements with implications.

### Outputs
A flow diagram plus a short list of opportunities.

### Quality checks
A stakeholder can trace their part end‑to‑end and understand where/why hand‑offs fail.

### Failure modes & mitigations
- **Over‑fitting to one person’s path** → validate with multiple interviews and converge on an archetype.
- **Too much detail too soon** → keep to major actors and transitions first, then layer detail as needed.
