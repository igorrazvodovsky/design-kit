name: "Forced Temporal Zoom (Journey Mapping)"
description: "Maps the product/service across time from pre‑acquisition to replacement to reveal unmet needs at each phase."

### When to use
- You need to design an experience that spans before‑during‑after use.
- Service or retail experiences have rough transitions or drop‑offs.

### Inputs
Concept map of the normal use (level 0); observations/interviews; time‑based events.

### Instructions
1) **Map level 0 (Normal Use).**
2) **Go back in time:** map **−1 First‑time Use**, **−2 Purchase**, **−3 Pre‑acquisition**.
3) **Go forward in time:** map **+1 Expert Use**, **+2 Failure/Service**, **+3 Replacement/Offboarding**.
4) **At each level,** capture physical and emotional touchpoints, risks, and opportunities.
5) **Summarize interventions** per level and identify cross‑level dependencies.

### Outputs
A 7‑level timeline map plus prioritized opportunities per phase.

### Quality checks
Each level articulates _both_ functional and emotional touchpoints.

### Failure modes & mitigations
**Only mapping feelings or only tasks** → capture both to see experience gaps clearly.
