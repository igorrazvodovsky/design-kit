name: "Forced Semantic Zoom (Ecosystem Mapping)"
description: "Systematically zooms in/out around a concept map to reveal tactical details and broader strategic context; use to frame opportunities beyond the artifact."

### When to use
- You want to understand the ecosystem around a product (people, policies, channels, spaces).
- You need to find opportunities outside the obvious point of use.

### Inputs
A level‑0 concept map; stakeholders willing to explore context.

### Instructions
1) **Start from level 0.** Use your concept map as the anchor.
2) **Zoom out (−1 to −3).** Redraw relationships at each step to expose brand, marketplace, and societal constraints.
3) **Zoom in (+1 to +3).** Redraw relationships to expose functions, controls, and attributes.
4) **Capture gaps and levers.** Note opportunities or risks revealed only at each level.
5) **Flag transitions.** Where moving across levels causes a hand‑off, mark it for deeper study.

### Outputs
A concise ecosystem map (limited to ±3 from level 0) with a list of level‑specific opportunities.

### Quality checks
Each zoom redraw changes content (not just scale) while preserving the container.
