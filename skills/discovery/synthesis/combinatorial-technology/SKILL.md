# Combinatorial technology analysis

## Purpose

Provide W. Brian Arthur's framework for analysing and designing purposeful systems. This specialised reframing technique views all technologies and systems as recursive combinations that exploit natural phenomena within specific domains, enabling systematic innovation through recombination rather than invention.

## When to Use

Apply this skill when:
- Analysing technological systems or products
- Designing new solutions through recombination
- Understanding system evolution and history
- Finding innovation opportunities through domain transfer
- Explaining why systems are structured as they are
- Users mention "technology", "system design", "innovation", or "how things work"

## Prerequisites

This skill builds on:
- **sensemaking-synthesis** (grandparent) - For understanding complexity
- **reframing** (parent) - For perspective shifting

Use this as the final, most specialised step in the cascade for technology-specific analysis.

## Core Principles

Remember these fundamental laws:

1. **All technologies are combinations** - New technologies are created by combining existing components, assemblies, or systems. Nothing is monolithic; everything is built from other technologies.

2. **Components are technologies** - Because components serve specific purposes, they are technologies in their own right. This makes the structure of technology deeply recursive—each part is itself a purposeful system.

3. **Technologies exploit phenomena** - At the heart of any technology is a natural effect (a phenomenon) that has been captured and harnessed for a specific use (a principle). The phenomenon is the natural effect; the principle is how it's put to use.

4. **Domains as languages** - Technologies cluster into "domains" (e.g., electronics, hydraulics, software) which act like languages or toolboxes. A domain provides a set of components and a "grammar" of accepted practices for combining them.

## References

This skill is based on W. Brian Arthur's work, particularly:

**Arthur, W. B. (2009). _The Nature of Technology: What It Is and How It Evolves_. Free Press.**

Arthur's framework provides a systematic way to understand technological evolution as a process of recursive combination rather than isolated invention. The concepts of phenomena, principles, domains, and recursive structure form the theoretical foundation for this analytical method.

## Method A: Analysis Mode

When users ask to analyse an existing system:

### Step 1: Recursive Decomposition

```
Decomposing [system] using Arthur's framework:

LEVEL 1 - System Purpose: [What it achieves]

LEVEL 2 - Major Assemblies:
├── [Assembly 1]: [Purpose it serves]
│   └── Exploits: [Phenomenon] through [Principle]
├── [Assembly 2]: [Purpose it serves]
│   └── Exploits: [Phenomenon] through [Principle]
└── [Assembly 3]: [Purpose it serves]
    └── Exploits: [Phenomenon] through [Principle]

LEVEL 3 - Components within [Assembly 1]:
├── [Component 1]: Exploits [phenomenon]
└── [Component 2]: Exploits [phenomenon]

[Continue until reaching natural phenomena or elementary operations]
```

### Step 2: Phenomena Mapping

```
Key phenomena being exploited:

PHYSICAL:
- [Phenomenon]: Used in [components] to achieve [purpose]

INFORMATIONAL:
- [Phenomenon]: Used in [components] to achieve [purpose]

PSYCHOLOGICAL/SOCIAL:
- [Phenomenon]: Used in [components] to achieve [purpose]
```

### Step 3: Domain Identification

```
Domains in play (each domain acts as a language/toolbox):

PRIMARY DOMAIN: [e.g., Electronics]
- Component vocabulary: [Available building blocks like transistors, resistors, integrated circuits]
- Grammar: [Rules and accepted practices for combining components]
- Native phenomena: [Natural effects this domain exploits]

BORROWED FROM: [e.g., Mechanical engineering]
- Imported components: [What was taken from this domain's vocabulary]
- Adaptation: [How components were modified to fit new domain's grammar]
- Cross-domain bridge: [How principles translate between domains]
```

### Step 4: Evolution Tracing

```
Evolutionary path:

PREDECESSOR: [Earlier version/approach]
- Limitation: [What it couldn't do]
- Phenomenon shift: [Old phenomenon] → [New phenomenon]

CURRENT: [Present system]
- Innovation: [What new combination enabled]

TENSIONS/KLUDGES:
- [Awkward joint]: [Component A] doesn't naturally fit with [Component B]
- Workaround: [How it's currently handled]
- Opportunity: [Better recombination possible]
```

## Method B: Synthesis Mode

When users seek innovation or new designs:

### Step 1: Component Inventory

```
Available components for recombination (surveying domain vocabularies):

FROM CURRENT DOMAIN:
- [Component]: Exploits [phenomenon] via [principle], could be used for [alternative purpose]
- Domain grammar allows: [Recombination possibilities within accepted practices]

FROM ADJACENT DOMAINS:
- [Domain name]: [Component] exploits [phenomenon] via [principle]
  → Could solve [problem in current domain]
  → Grammar adaptation needed: [How to translate between domain languages]

UNEXPLOITED PHENOMENA:
- [Phenomenon]: Natural effect observed but not yet harnessed
  → Potential principle: [How it could be put to use]
  → Would enable: [New capability]
```

### Step 2: Recombination Strategies

```
Innovation pathways:

PATH 1 - Phenomenon Substitution:
Replace [current phenomenon] with [alternative phenomenon]
→ Enables: [New capability]
→ Removes: [Current limitation]

PATH 2 - Domain Bridge:
Import [solution] from [foreign domain]
→ Solves: [Persistent problem]
→ Risk: [Integration challenge]

PATH 3 - Recursive Deepening:
Add layer between [Component A] and [Component B]
→ Allows: [More sophisticated control/function]

PATH 4 - Exaptation:
Repurpose [existing component] for [unintended use]
→ Leverages: [Existing investment]
→ Creates: [Unexpected value]
```

### Step 3: Synthesis Proposal

```
Proposed recombination:

COMBINE:
- [Component from Domain A]: Exploits [phenomenon X] via [principle Y]
- [Component from Domain B]: Exploits [phenomenon M] via [principle N]
- [Unexploited phenomenon C]: Captured through [new principle P]

TO CREATE:
[Description of new system]

HOW IT WORKS (phenomena → principles → functions):
1. [Phenomenon A] harnessed through [Principle A] → enables [Function 1]
2. [Phenomenon B] harnessed through [Principle B] → enables [Function 2]
3. These combine recursively to produce [Emergent capability]

DOMAIN GRAMMAR:
- Borrows [component vocabulary] from [Domain X]
- Adapts [grammar/practices] from [Domain Y]
- Creates new grammar for: [Novel combination pattern]

ADVANTAGES OVER CURRENT:
- Eliminates [current kludge]
- Exploits [previously unused phenomenon]
- Simpler/more elegant because [reason]
- Enables [capability impossible in single domain]
```

## Example Applications

### Analysis Example: Modern Smartphone

```
RECURSIVE STRUCTURE:
Smartphone = Communication device + Computer + Sensor array + Display system
(Each assembly is itself a technology built from component technologies)

Communication Assembly:
├── Radio transceiver: Phenomenon (electromagnetic radiation) → Principle (modulation/demodulation)
├── Antenna: Phenomenon (wave resonance) → Principle (impedance matching)
└── Protocol stack: Phenomenon (information theory) → Principle (error correction, compression)

PHENOMENA → PRINCIPLES MAP:
- Electromagnetic spectrum → Modulation schemes for wireless communication
- Semiconductor physics → Logic gates and signal processing
- Capacitive coupling → Touch detection via charge differential
- Photon emission → Pixel illumination through LCD/OLED
- Electrochemical reactions → Energy storage and release

DOMAIN BRIDGES (languages borrowed and combined):
- From photography domain: Image sensor components + exposure control grammar
- From audio domain: Codec vocabulary + signal processing grammar
- From gaming domain: GPU components + graphics pipeline grammar
- From telephony domain: Radio components + network protocol grammar

DOMAIN GRAMMARS IN USE:
- Electronics: Component assembly, power distribution, signal routing
- Software: API composition, state management, event handling
- RF Engineering: Frequency allocation, antenna design, signal propagation

TENSIONS IDENTIFIED:
- Battery life vs performance (kludged with throttling)
- Thinness vs thermal management (kludged with thermal pads)
- Universal design vs specific use cases (kludged with apps)
```

### Synthesis Example: Next-Generation Learning System

```
OPPORTUNITY: Current online learning exploits visual display + recorded speech but ignores spatial memory and social learning phenomena.

PHENOMENA → PRINCIPLES RECOMBINATION:
- Spatial cognition (place cells) → Memory palace principle for concept location
- Social facilitation → Presence awareness via avatar systems
- Distributed practice effect → Spaced repetition scheduling algorithms
- Dopamine reward cycles → Achievement/progression mechanics

DOMAIN VOCABULARY BORROWED:
- From VR/AR domain: 3D rendering components, spatial tracking, haptic feedback
- From gaming domain: Quest systems, progression trees, achievement unlocks
- From social networks: Presence indicators, activity feeds, peer connections
- From cognitive science: Spaced repetition algorithms, chunking strategies

NEW SYSTEM: Spatial Knowledge Environment
- Knowledge represented as explorable 3D spaces (phenomenon: spatial memory)
- Social presence of other learners visible (phenomenon: social facilitation)
- Concepts physically positioned using memory palace principle
- Progress through movement and construction, not passive watching

DOMAIN GRAMMAR CREATED:
- Combines VR navigation rules with pedagogical sequencing practices
- Merges game progression grammar with learning outcome taxonomies
- Creates new grammar for: social spatial learning experiences

PHENOMENON SHIFT:
From: Visual information transfer (exploits visual processing)
To: Embodied spatial construction (exploits place cells + social cognition + motor memory)

ADVANTAGES:
- Eliminates passive learning kludge
- Exploits previously unused spatial memory phenomena
- More elegant because learning aligns with multiple cognitive systems simultaneously
```

## Key Behaviours

### DO:
- Always distinguish between phenomena (natural effects) and principles (how they're harnessed)
- Trace recursive structure to natural effects—remember components are technologies too
- Identify domain vocabularies (available components) and grammars (combination rules)
- Look for domain bridges where vocabularies and grammars are borrowed
- Identify kludges as innovation opportunities
- Consider exaptation potential (repurposing components for unintended uses)
- Show evolution from previous combinations
- Treat domains as languages with distinct component vocabularies and grammatical rules

### DON'T:
- Stop decomposition too early—continue until reaching natural phenomena
- Ignore the deeply recursive nature of technology
- Forget that every component serves a specific purpose, making it a technology
- Overlook psychological/social phenomena (they're exploitable too)
- Assume current structure is optimal—tensions reveal opportunities
- Confuse phenomena (natural effects) with principles (purposeful applications)

## Integration Notes

This skill enhances general reframing by:
- Providing systematic decomposition method
- Focusing on phenomena exploitation
- Emphasising recombination over invention
- Making innovation mechanical rather than magical

Use this as the final specialised step when users need to:
- Understand complex systems deeply
- Find innovation through recombination
- Identify why solutions are structured as they are
- Bridge between different domains
- See technology as evolution, not creation

## Output Quality Markers

Analysis succeeds when:
- Hidden structure becomes visible
- Innovation opportunities emerge from identified tensions
- Users understand why systems evolved as they did
- Domain bridges reveal unexpected connections
- Recombination paths become concrete and actionable
