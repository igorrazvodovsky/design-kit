name: "Concept Mapping with Semantic Zoom Levels"
description: "Builds a ‘picture of understanding’ with nouns and verbs, then traverses zoom levels to connect strategy to details."
---

### When to use
- You need a single map that ties strategy, product, features, and details together.
- A topic is too complex to hold in working memory without structure.

### Inputs
- Research notes; list of key entities (nouns) and relationships (verbs).

### Instructions
1) **Draft the level‑0 concept map.** Draw entities (nouns) and relationships (verbs) for the focal product/system.
2) **Traverse zoom levels.** Redraw the map across adjacent levels to reveal different questions:
   - **−3 Global/World**
   - **−2 Company/Marketplace**
   - **−1 Product line or Brand**
   - **0 Product**
   - **+1 Feature/Function**
   - **+2 Control/UI element**
   - **+3 Attribute/Detail**
3) **Keep containers consistent.** Use the same container label at each level; change only the contents.
4) **Annotate insights.** For each level, capture 1–2 implications for design or research.

### Outputs
- A stack of 7 coherent maps (or a subset limited to ±3 levels) plus implications.

### Quality checks
- Adjacent levels connect cleanly (no orphaned entities when moving up/down one level).

### Failure modes & mitigations
- **Zooming too far** → stay within ±3 practical levels to keep maps actionable.
