name: "Insight Combination (Insights × Patterns → Ideas)"
description: "Generates many grounded ideas by pairing problem‑specific insights (yellow) with design patterns (blue) and capturing resulting ideas (green)."

### When to use
- You have emerging insights and a sense of recurring patterns in the domain.
- You want breadth of ideas tied to research _and_ to proven paradigms.

### Inputs
- **Yellow** cards: insight statements (Observation + “I know that…”).
- **Blue** cards: relevant patterns from the domain or adjacent domains.
- **Green** cards: to capture idea candidates.

### Instructions
1) **Write insights** (yellow) and **patterns** (blue) succinctly.
2) **Combine at random** and look for meaningful affinities.
3) **Capture ideas** (green) when a pair sparks something plausible.
4) **Defer judgment;** focus on quantity first. Evaluate feasibility later.

### Outputs
- A wall of green idea cards clustered by opportunity.

### Quality checks
- Each idea can be traced back to exactly one insight + one pattern.

### Failure modes & mitigations
- **No patterns at hand** → build a quick pattern library from precedents before the session.
- **Premature critique** → timebox critique later; keep combination divergent.
