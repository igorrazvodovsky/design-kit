# Prepare stakeholder interview

## Purpose

Structure stakeholder interviews to gather cross-functional perspectives, understand project needs, team motivations, and build project alignment. Create two-way dialogues that surface each stakeholder's needs, expectations, assumptions, and personal stakes in the project.

## When to use

Use this skill when:
- Starting complex projects with unclear challenge boundaries
- Leading cross-functional initiatives requiring multiple perspectives
- Need to understand organisational context and team alignment
- Building relationships with project stakeholders
- Assessing stakeholder confidence and commitment to project

## What I can help with

### Interview preparation
- Identify relevant stakeholders and project team members
- Apply snowball recruiting techniques to discover additional stakeholders
- Map stakeholders' relationships to the project
- Draft interview objectives aligned with project needs

### Discussion structure
- Create interview guides balancing structure and flexibility
- Develop questions that surface:
  - Stakeholder needs and expectations
  - Project assumptions and mental models
  - Motivations for participation
  - Confidence levels in project success
- Design probes for uncovering implicit goals and concerns
- Structure questions to build personal connections

### Facilitation guidance
- Techniques for creating two-way dialogue
- Approaches for showing understanding of personal stakes
- Methods for assessing stakeholder confidence
- Frameworks for capturing responses during interviews

### Output preparation
- Design briefing materials explaining interview purpose
- Create templates for documenting findings
- Structure outputs to feed into follow-up activities

## Key principles

- _Build connection first_ - Show understanding of stakeholders' personal stakes before diving into project details
- _Create dialogue, not interrogation_ - Structure as two-way conversation, not one-sided questioning
- _Surface assumptions explicitly_ - Make implicit project assumptions visible and discussable
- _Map relationships_ - Understand how each stakeholder relates to the project and to other stakeholders
- _Assess confidence_ - Gauge stakeholder belief in project success as indicator of potential blockers
