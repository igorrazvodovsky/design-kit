## Interview approach

Keep stakeholder interviews conversational rather than following a rigid script. Prepare a list of topics to guide the discussion, but let the conversation flow naturally. Ask open-ended questions that reveal insights about the project.

## Essential questions

### What's your role with respect to this product?

Understanding each stakeholder's role helps you:
- Know whose perspective they represent
- Assess the weight to give their opinions on different topics
- Identify gaps in stakeholder coverage

### What did you do before this?

Background context helps you understand:
- Their expertise and credibility
- The perspective they bring to the project
- Why they were selected for their current role

### What is this product supposed to be?

This question surfaces:
- Different mental models of the product
- Scope boundaries and assumptions
- Areas of alignment and misalignment

**Also ask: "What is the product _not_ meant to be?"** - This clarifies boundaries and constraints.

### Who is this product for?

Listen for:
- Variations in how stakeholders describe the audience
- Different assumptions about user needs
- Gaps between intended users and current users

### When will the version you're designing be released?

This reveals:
- Timeline pressure and constraints
- Realistic versus aspirational timelines
- Whether timeline is fixed or flexible

### What worries you about this project?

This is one of the most valuable questions. It uncovers:
- Real risks the team faces
- Organisational challenges
- Technical concerns
- Political sensitivities
- Resource constraints

Listen for underlying anxieties about:
- "The worst thing that could happen"
- Specific failure scenarios
- Known unknowns

### What should this project accomplish for the business?

Different stakeholders may have different business objectives. This helps you:
- Understand success criteria
- Identify conflicting priorities
- Frame design decisions in business terms

### How will you personally define success for this project?

Personal definitions of success often differ from business objectives. They reveal:
- Individual motivations
- Career stakes
- Department politics
- Measurement criteria

## Building consensus

These interviews help build consensus by:
- Making different perspectives visible
- Clarifying project scope
- Surfacing potential challenges before design work begins
- Creating shared understanding across the team

## Discovering additional contacts

Always ask: "Is there anyone you think we need to speak with who isn't on our list?"

This snowball technique helps you:
- Identify missing stakeholders
- Find subject matter experts
- Uncover political considerations
- Ensure comprehensive coverage
