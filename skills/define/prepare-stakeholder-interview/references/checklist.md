This checklist provides a quick reference for conducting stakeholder interviews across different organisational roles.

## Things to watch out for

**Presumed constraints** - Ask why they are constraints. Many "requirements" are actually assumptions that can be questioned.

**Jumping to solutions** - Ask what problem the solution would solve. Probe for underlying needs rather than accepting proposed solutions at face value.

## Questions for all stakeholders

These universal questions apply regardless of role:

1. **What is your role in this project?**
2. **What did you do before this?** - Helps understand their perspective and expertise
3. **What is this product going to be?**
4. **Who is this product for?**
5. **When is the version we're designing going to be released?**
6. **What worries you about this project? What's the worst thing that could happen?**
7. **What should this project accomplish for the business?**
8. **How will you, personally, define success for this project?**
9. **Is there anyone you think we need to speak with who isn't on our list? Who?**
10. **How would you like to be involved in the rest of the project, and what's the best way to reach you?**

## Marketing stakeholders

- **Who are your customers and users today, and how do you want that to be different in five years?**
- **How does this product fit into the overall product strategy?**
- **Who are the biggest competitors and what worries you about them?**
- **How do you expect to differentiate this product?**
- **Using a few key words, how do you want people to see your brand** (both the company brand and the product brand)?
- **What is the current state of the identity, and can we see a style guide** (if there is one) and examples of it applied to materials?

## Engineering stakeholders

- **What technology decisions have already been made, and how firm are they?**
- **How large is the development team assigned to the project, and what are their skills?**
- **Would you draw a diagram and tell me in lay terms how the system works?** (existing products only)

## Sales stakeholders

- **Who is typically involved in the purchase decision?**
- **Why do customers buy a product like this one, and why this one over competitor's?**
- **When you lose sales, what are the most common reasons?**
- **What things do customers complain about or ask for most often, and why?**

## Senior executives

Questions similar to those for marketing stakeholders, plus:

- **What do I need to know that you don't think other members of your team have said?**
- **If you had to choose between going to market on schedule with a flawed product, or going to market late with a solid product, which would you choose?** (If there seems to be some conflict on this point)

## Subject matter experts

- **What are the typical demographics and skills of potential users, and how much variation in these is typical?**
- **What distinctions in user roles and tasks would you expect us to see?**
- **What sorts of workflows or practices do you think we'll be seeing in the field?**

## Other product team members

**QA:** What problems do you currently see in development?

**Support or customer service:** What problems do you see most often?

**Training or technical documentation:** Where do users most often get confused today?
