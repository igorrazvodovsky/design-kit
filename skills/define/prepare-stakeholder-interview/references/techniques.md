# Stakeholder interview techniques

## Creating two-way dialogue

Stakeholder interviews should feel like conversations, not interrogations. The goal is mutual understanding, not just data extraction.

### Building connection
- Acknowledge the stakeholder's expertise and perspective
- Share your understanding of their role and relationship to the project
- Explain how their input will be used
- Show genuine interest in their viewpoint

### Demonstrating understanding of personal stakes
Each stakeholder has personal reasons for caring about the project beyond organisational goals:
- Career development opportunities
- Professional reputation
- Team dynamics and relationships
- Resource allocation concerns
- Strategic positioning

Ask directly about these stakes:
- "What does success on this project mean for you personally?"
- "What concerns you most about how this might unfold?"
- "What would make this project feel like a win from your perspective?"

## Assessing confidence

Stakeholder confidence levels reveal potential project risks and blockers.

### Confidence indicators
- _High confidence_ - Clear vision, specific plans, identifies resources
- _Moderate confidence_ - General optimism with acknowledged uncertainties
- _Low confidence_ - Expresses doubts, identifies multiple blockers, vague outcomes

### Questions for gauging confidence
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this project will succeed?"
- "What would need to happen to increase your confidence?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this initiative?"
- "What could derail this project?"

Low confidence doesn't mean pessimism - it often indicates valuable risk awareness.

## Question frameworks

### Opening questions
- "Tell me about your role in this project"
- "How did you first get involved with this initiative?"
- "What's your understanding of what we're trying to achieve?"

### Exploring needs and expectations
- "What outcomes would make this project successful from your perspective?"
- "What do you need from this project?"
- "What are you hoping will change as a result of this work?"
- "What would disappointment look like?"

### Surfacing assumptions
- "What assumptions are you making about how this will work?"
- "What do you believe needs to be true for this to succeed?"
- "What are you taking for granted about the problem?"
- "What constraints do you see as fixed versus flexible?"

### Understanding motivations
- "Why is this project important to you?"
- "What drew you to participate in this initiative?"
- "What aspect of this project are you most excited about?"
- "What would happen if we didn't do this project?"

### Identifying concerns
- "What worries you about this project?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What's the worst case scenario in your mind?"
- "What obstacles do you anticipate?"

## Snowball recruiting

Use each interview to discover additional stakeholders:
- "Who else should I be talking to about this?"
- "Whose perspective am I missing?"
- "Who will be most affected by this project?"
- "Who has tried something similar before?"
- "Who disagrees with this approach?"

## Capturing responses

Document both content and context:
- Direct quotes that capture perspective
- Emotional tone and confidence level
- Areas of certainty versus uncertainty
- Assumptions stated and implied
- Relationships to other stakeholders mentioned
- Follow-up questions raised
