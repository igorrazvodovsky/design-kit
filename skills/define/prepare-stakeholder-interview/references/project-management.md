## Interview scheduling

### Duration and pacing
- Plan for 3-4 days of interviews
- Limit to 6 interviews per day maximum

### Sequencing

**Schedule critical stakeholders early in the process** - This ensures you:
- Get essential context first
- Have time to follow up if needed
- Can identify additional stakeholders to interview
- Build momentum with key relationships

**Aim to complete stakeholder discussions before user research** - This sequence allows you to:
- Understand organisational context first
- Frame user research questions appropriately
- Know what assumptions to test
- Identify whose interests user research serves

## Identifying stakeholders

### Who to include

Identify all relevant stakeholders across:
- Product and business strategy (marketing, product management)
- Technical implementation (engineering, architecture)
- Customer-facing functions (sales, support, training)
- Quality and operations (QA, technical writing, compliance)
- Executive leadership (cross-functional decision-makers)
- Domain expertise (subject matter experts)

### Snowball recruiting

Use each interview to discover additional stakeholders:
- Ask who else you should speak with
- Identify whose perspective is missing
- Find subject matter experts
- Uncover political considerations

## Interview preparation

### Understand organisational context

Research before interviews:
- Organisation structure
- Product strategy and roadmap
- Market position and competitors
- Recent changes or initiatives
- Known challenges

### Prepare stakeholder-specific questions

Customise interviews based on:
- Stakeholder's role and expertise
- Their relationship to the project
- Known concerns or priorities
- Information gaps

## Organisational principles

### Leverage available expertise

Make use of stakeholders':
- Domain knowledge
- Technical expertise
- Market understanding
- Customer relationships
- Organisational history

### Understand hopes, fears, and goals

Every stakeholder interview should surface:
- What they hope the project will achieve
- What concerns them about it
- How they personally define success
- What constraints they perceive

### Avoid taking assumptions at face value

**Question presumed constraints** - Many "requirements" are actually assumptions that can be challenged.

**Ask "why" repeatedly** - Surface the reasoning behind stated constraints:
- Why does this need to work this way?
- Why is this considered fixed?
- What problem would it cause to change this?

### Build essential relationships

Stakeholder interviews aren't just information gathering - they're relationship building:
- Establish credibility
- Demonstrate respect for expertise
- Create allies for later design work
- Build trust across functions

## When stakeholder access is limited

If you can't get direct access to stakeholders:

**Try persuasive communication** - Explain value of interviews:
- How insights will improve the product
- Why their perspective matters
- How little time it requires
- What they'll get in return

**Seek access to relevant documents** - If interviews aren't possible:
- Strategy documents
- Market research
- Technical specifications
- Customer feedback

**Build relationships in stakeholder departments** - Find advocates who can:
- Provide informal insights
- Connect you with the right people
- Validate your understanding
- Champion design involvement

**Persistently look for involvement opportunities** - Keep trying to build connections through:
- Project meetings
- Cross-functional initiatives
- Informal conversations
- Shared challenges

## Overall goal

_"Goal-Directed design isn't just about accomplishing user goals; a product or service that doesn't also accomplish a business goal is a failure."_

Stakeholder interviews ensure you understand business goals as thoroughly as user goals, creating designs that serve both.

## Creating a detailed schedule

Prepare a schedule that includes:
- Stakeholder name and role
- Interview time and location
- Key topics to cover
- Pre-interview research completed
- Post-interview synthesis plan

Share schedules with:
- Interview team members
- Project sponsors
- Administrative coordinators
