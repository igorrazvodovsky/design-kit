# Stakeholder interview references

This directory contains reference materials for conducting stakeholder interviews, drawing from Kim Goodwin's _Designing for the Digital Age_ and related research on interview techniques.

## How to use these references

Start with the checklist for quick reference during interviews, then consult specific guides based on who you're interviewing and what stage you're at in the process.

## Reference documents

### Quick reference
**[checklist.md](checklist.md)** - Condensed question list organised by stakeholder role. Keep this handy during interviews.

### General guidance
**[techniques.md](techniques.md)** - Core techniques for creating two-way dialogue, assessing confidence, and building connection

**[general.md](general.md)** - Essential questions for all stakeholders and how to interpret responses

### Role-specific guidance
**[engineering.md](engineering.md)** - Specific approaches for interviewing engineering stakeholders, addressing scepticism, and understanding technical constraints

**[executives-sme.md](executives-sme.md)** - Techniques for interviewing executives and subject matter experts, including specialised team members (QA, support, training)

### Planning and logistics
**[project-management.md](project-management.md)** - Scheduling, sequencing, identifying stakeholders, and managing the interview process

## Recommended reading order

### When planning stakeholder interviews
1. Start with [project-management.md](project-management.md) for scheduling and stakeholder identification
2. Review [general-interview.md](general-interview.md) for universal questions
3. Consult role-specific guides for stakeholders you'll interview

### Before conducting interviews
1. Review [interview-techniques.md](interview-techniques.md) for facilitation approaches
2. Print or bookmark [checklist.md](checklist.md) for quick reference
3. Prepare stakeholder-specific questions using the appropriate guides

### During interviews
Keep [checklist.md](checklist.md) accessible as a prompt for topics to cover

## Key themes across references

### Question presumed constraints
Many stated "requirements" are actually assumptions. Ask why constraints exist and what problem would be created by changing them.

### Avoid jumping to solutions
When stakeholders propose solutions, ask what problem the solution would solve. Probe for underlying needs rather than accepting solutions at face value.

### Build relationships, not just gather data
Stakeholder interviews establish credibility, demonstrate respect for expertise, and create allies for design work. They're as much about relationship building as information gathering.

### Surface hopes, fears, and personal stakes
Understanding what each stakeholder personally cares about reveals motivations, concerns, and success criteria that may not align with official project goals.
