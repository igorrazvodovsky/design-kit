## Design process

- context, input, strategy, etc.
	- vision, frame, objective
	-  product roadmap as an input - i.e. choosing what to do
- discovery
	- [[sketch-frame]], [[sketch-objective]], [[sketch-context]] are run to define **provisional** versions that will be iterated on.
	- run [[form-question]]
	- output [[actionable-frame-question]]
	- review and edit
	- research: planning
		- run either a [[sketch-study-plan]] or [[sketch-research-driven-design-project]]
		-
	- research: execution
		- ...
	- research: processing
		-
	- synthesis
		- ...
	- focus
		- ...
	- outputs
		- frame, objective, and context descriptions are updated to reflect discovery results
		- plus big idea
