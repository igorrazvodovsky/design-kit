## Design process

- Preparation
	- [[sketch-frame]], [[sketch-objective]], [[sketch-context]] are run to define **provisional** versions that will be iterated on.
	- TODO: ==stakeholder interviews==
- Desk research
	- Find any existing contact list of users
- Secondary research: plan
	- Search and review past internal research
	- Review repository to gather and review past research and user needs
- Research: plan
- discovery
	- run [[form-question]]
	- output [[actionable-frame-question]]
	- review and edit
	- research: planning
		- run either a [[sketch-study-plan]] or [[sketch-research-driven-design-project]]
		- run [plan-interview](plan-interview.md)
	- research: execution
		- TODO: ==participant recruiting & coordination==
		- interview, xN
			- generate the transcript
	- research: processing
		- TODO: ==interview debrief==, xN
	- synthesis
		- combine insights
		- reframe
		- map
		- sensemaking workshop
		- jobs-to-be-done
	- focus
		- ...
	- outputs
		- decide on [effective reporting](references/effective%20reporting.md)
		- frame, objective, and context descriptions are updated to reflect discovery results
		- plus big idea
