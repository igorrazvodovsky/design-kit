# User Needs Refinement Summary

**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Scope**: Complete refinement of all user needs in [example-1/outputs/needs/](needs/)
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Comprehensive refinement of 75 user needs following the process outlined in [@commands/discovery/explore/refine-user-needs.md](../../commands/discovery/explore/refine-user-needs.md) and best practices from [references/user-needs-best-practices.md](../../references/user-needs-best-practices.md).

## Changes Applied

### Phase 1: Standardization (4 files)
Fixed structural inconsistencies in needs files:

| File | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|-----------|
| [accept an invite and land in the correct workspace.md](needs/accept%20an%20invite%20and%20land%20in%20the%20correct%20workspace.md) | Empty category, extra field | Added "access" category, "onboarding flow" theme, removed "acceptance criteria" field |
| [assign roles and default permissions.md](needs/assign%20roles%20and%20default%20permissions.md) | Empty category, extra field | Added "collaboration" category, "access control" theme, removed "acceptance criteria" field |
| [import my existing data.md](needs/import%20my%20existing%20data.md) | Empty category, extra field | Added "migration" category, "data continuity" theme, removed "acceptance criteria" field |
| [blocked during setup.md](needs/blocked%20during%20setup.md) | Empty category, extra field | Added "learning" category, "onboarding support" theme, removed "acceptance criteria" field |

### Phase 2: Journey Stage Assignment (49 files)
Systematically assigned user journey stages to all needs with empty stage fields:

**Journey Stage Distribution:**
- _daily use_: 38 needs (core operations, collaboration, bulk actions, discovery)
- _optimization_: 5 needs (automation features - new stage created)
- _customization_: 4 needs (personalization and preferences)
- _onboarding_: 9 needs (previously assigned)
- _offboarding_: 4 needs (previously assigned)
- _registration_: 3 needs (previously assigned)
- _pre-registration_: 1 need (previously assigned)
- _setup_: 1 need (previously assigned)
- _access_: 1 need (previously assigned)

**Result**: 100% journey stage coverage across all 74 active needs

### Phase 3: Category Refinement (2 files)

**Merged singleton category:**
- [understand what I can accomplish.md](needs/understand%20what%20I%20can%20accomplish.md): "orientation" → "discovery"
- _Rationale_: Singleton category with only 1 need; better fit in discovery

**Corrected category mismatch:**
- [automate repetitive tasks.md](needs/automate%20repetitive%20tasks.md): "performance" → "automation"
- Also updated theme: "automation" → "workflow optimization"
- _Rationale_: Content better aligned with automation category

### Phase 4: Duplicate Resolution (1 merge)

**Merged duplicate needs:**
- Source: [know what others can do with my data.md](needs/archived/know%20what%20others%20can%20do%20with%20my%20data.md) (ID 126)
- Target: [understand who has access.md](needs/understand%20who%20has%20access.md) (ID 125)
- _New need_: "understand who has access and what they can do"
- _Rationale_: Nearly identical needs addressing access awareness in collaborative contexts with similar outcomes ("collaborate safely")
- _Result_: ID 126 archived with full documentation

### Phase 5: Outcome Review
Reviewed 8 efficiency-related outcomes for potential standardization:
- _Finding_: Outcomes are contextually distinct and appropriately varied
- _Action_: No changes needed
- _Note_: The 2 identical "I can work more efficiently" outcomes are already consistent

## Final Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total needs** | 74 active + 1 archived |
| **User types** | 3 (user, admin, switcher) |
| **Categories** | 18 (reduced from 19) |
| **Journey stages** | 7 distinct stages |
| **Journey stage coverage** | 100% |
| **Files modified** | 56 total |
| **Needs merged** | 1 |
| **Structure issues fixed** | 4 |

## Category Distribution

| Category | Count | % of Total |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| collaboration | 16* | 21.6% |
| core actions | 8 | 10.8% |
| bulk operations | 6 | 8.1% |
| automation | 5 | 6.8% |
| trust & safety | 5 | 6.8% |
| personalization | 4 | 5.4% |
| learning | 4 | 5.4% |
| migration | 3 | 4.1% |
| data portability | 3 | 4.1% |
| access | 3 | 4.1% |
| performance | 3 | 4.1% |
| discovery | 3 | 4.1% |
| _Other categories < 3 needs_ | 11 | 14.9% |

*Collaboration reduced from 17 to 16 due to merge

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Strengths
✓ Strong collaboration need coverage (16 needs, 21.6%)
✓ Well-structured "who is" field usage across all needs
✓ Clear thematic threads (automation workflow, access control, bulk operations)
✓ Good bulk operations workflow (6 needs forming coherent sequence)

### Gaps Identified

**High priority research areas:**
1. Admin user workflows (only 3 needs - 4% of total)
2. Integration and ecosystem needs (none identified)
3. Power user vs casual user differentiation (all users treated uniformly)

**Other gaps:**
- Pre-registration evaluation (1 need only)
- Mobile/cross-device usage patterns
- Team growth journey (solo → team transition)
- Reporting and analytics needs
- Re-engagement after absence

See [research-questions.md](research-questions.md) for detailed research priorities.

## Outcomes & Patterns

### Common outcome themes:
- **Efficiency** (8 occurrences): Speed, productivity, reducing friction
- **Collaboration/coordination** (12 occurrences): Working together, shared context
- **Trust/confidence** (8 occurrences): Safety, reliability, data security
- **Understanding/awareness** (11 occurrences): Knowing state, making informed decisions

### Strong thematic clusters:
- Automation progression: templates → rules → triggers → scheduling
- Access control: visibility, permissions, roles, external sharing
- Bulk operations: select → filter → act → undo (safety-focused)
- Onboarding cluster: flow, support, migration, validation

## Repository Health Indicators

✅ **Excellent**:
- 100% journey stage coverage
- No singleton categories
- Consistent structure across all needs
- Clear archival process established
- Research gaps documented

✅ **Good**:
- Well-distributed categories (largest = 21.6%)
- Clear user type definitions
- Strong thematic organization

⚠️ **Needs attention**:
- Admin needs underrepresented (3 needs only)
- Integration needs missing entirely
- No user segmentation beyond basic types

## Files Created

1. **[needs-analysis.md](needs-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of patterns, gaps, and recommendations
2. **[research-questions.md](research-questions.md)** - Prioritized research areas to address gaps
3. **[refinement-summary.md](refinement-summary.md)** - This document
4. **[needs/archived/](needs/archived/)** - Directory for merged/retired needs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (recommended within 1-2 weeks)
1. ⏳ Review new "optimization" journey stage with team - validate it makes sense
2. ⏳ Plan research for high-priority gaps (admin workflows, integrations)
3. ⏳ Create project note linking relevant needs for next initiative

### Short-term (recommended within 1-2 months)
4. ⏳ Conduct admin user interviews to expand admin needs
5. ⏳ Survey users about integration/ecosystem needs
6. ⏳ Develop persona documentation based on refined structure
7. ⏳ Create outcome-based clustering analysis

### Ongoing maintenance
8. ⏳ Review needs at start of each new project
9. ⏳ Add new needs discovered during research
10. ⏳ Update [needs-analysis.md](needs-analysis.md) quarterly

## Process Notes

### What Worked Well
- Systematic approach through 5 phases prevented missed issues
- Using specialized agent for bulk journey stage assignment was efficient
- Clear categorization criteria made decisions straightforward
- Reference to best practices document ensured quality

### Lessons Learned
- The "who is" field is excellent for capturing cross-cutting attributes
- Creating new journey stage ("optimization") better represented automation progression
- Most operational needs naturally fit "daily use" - this stage is a catch-all
- Efficiency outcomes vary by context - avoid over-standardization

### Recommendations for Future Refinements
- Start with journey stage assignment - it reveals other structural issues
- Don't force outcome standardization when context varies
- Document merge rationale immediately in archived files
- Create new journey stages when clear progression patterns emerge
