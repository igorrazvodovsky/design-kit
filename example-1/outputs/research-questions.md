# Research Questions

Based on the user needs analysis, the following areas require additional research to ensure complete coverage of user needs.

## Admin User Needs

**Current state**: Only 3 admin needs identified (workspace membership, role assignment, team setup)

**Research questions**:
- What administrative tasks do admins perform beyond initial setup?
- How do admins monitor and manage ongoing team activity?
- What control do admins need over team data, security, and compliance?
- How do admins handle billing, subscription, and resource management?
- What analytics or reporting do admins need about team usage?
- How do admins manage integrations and system-wide configurations?
- What happens when admin responsibilities transfer between people?

**Methods**: Interview admins across different team sizes and industries

## Pre-Registration / Evaluation Stage

**Current state**: Only 1 need ("understand system value before committing")

**Research questions**:
- How do prospective users discover and evaluate the system?
- What specific questions must be answered before sign-up?
- What evidence or proof points matter during evaluation?
- Do users trial features before committing? Which ones?
- What causes prospects to abandon during evaluation?
- How do prospects compare this system to alternatives?
- What role do demos, documentation, and reviews play?

**Methods**: Analyze sign-up funnel data, interview recent converts, survey those who abandoned

---

## Integration and Ecosystem Needs

**Current state**: No integration needs identified

**Research questions**:
- What external tools do users need to connect with?
- What data needs to flow in/out of the system?
- What triggers external system actions?
- How do users want notifications delivered (Slack, email, etc.)?
- What APIs or automation tools do power users need?
- How do users share data between this system and others?

**Methods**: Survey current users about their tool ecosystem, analyze feature requests

---

## Mobile and Cross-Device Usage

**Current state**: No mobile or device-specific needs identified (1 "work offline" need exists)

**Research questions**:
- Do users need mobile access? For which tasks?
- How does usage differ across desktop, tablet, mobile?
- What sync/continuity needs exist across devices?
- Are there location-specific needs (on-site vs remote)?
- What happens when connectivity is limited or intermittent?
- Do users switch between devices mid-task?

**Methods**: Analyze usage patterns by device, interview mobile-first users

---

## Team Growth Journey

**Current state**: No needs about transitioning from individual to team usage

**Research questions**:
- How do solo users decide to invite others?
- What changes when the first team member joins?
- What collaborative patterns emerge in small teams (2-5) vs larger teams?
- How do teams organize as they grow (permissions, structure, workflows)?
- What causes team expansion to stall?
- How do users onboard their teammates (distinct from admin setup)?

**Methods**: Cohort analysis of team growth patterns, interview users at different team sizes

---

## Power User vs Casual User Differentiation

**Current state**: All "user" needs treated uniformly (71 needs)

**Research questions**:
- How do usage patterns differ between heavy and light users?
- What advanced needs emerge for power users?
- Do occasional users have different priorities than daily users?
- Are there distinct "creator" vs "consumer" user types?
- What causes users to level up from casual to power usage?
- Are there diminishing returns where features become overwhelming?

**Methods**: Segment users by activity level, interview users across spectrum

---

## Re-engagement and Renewal

**Current state**: No needs about returning after absence or ongoing value

**Research questions**:
- What brings users back after period of inactivity?
- How do users re-orient after time away?
- What ongoing value is needed to maintain engagement?
- What causes users to stop using the system (without fully offboarding)?
- How do users decide whether to renew subscriptions?
- Are there seasonal or project-based usage patterns?

**Methods**: Analyze churn and reactivation patterns, interview dormant users

---

## Reporting and Analytics

**Current state**: No reporting needs identified

**Research questions**:
- What insights do users want to extract from their data?
- What reports or dashboards would be valuable?
- Do users need to share reports with stakeholders?
- What metrics matter for individual users vs teams?
- Are there compliance or audit reporting requirements?
- How do users track progress toward goals?

**Methods**: Interview users about decision-making processes, analyze export usage

---

## Domain-Specific Variations

**Current state**: Needs are generic across domains

**Research questions**:
- How do needs vary by industry or use case?
- What domain-specific terminology or concepts matter?
- Are there regulatory requirements specific to certain domains?
- What integrations or workflows are domain-specific?
- Are there underserved domain segments?

**Methods**: Segment analysis by industry, interview users in specific domains

---

## Collaboration Depth

**Current state**: 17 collaboration needs identified - largest category, but may have gaps

**Research questions**:
- How do distributed teams collaborate differently than co-located teams?
- What synchronous vs asynchronous collaboration patterns exist?
- How do users handle version control and merge conflicts?
- What role does discussion/commentary play vs direct changes?
- How do users achieve consensus or make decisions together?
- Are there needs around presenting or demoing work to others?

**Methods**: Observe collaborative sessions, interview teams with different working models

---

## Priority Ranking

**High priority** (critical gaps):
1. Admin user needs - only 3 needs is insufficient
2. Integration and ecosystem - likely critical for adoption
3. Power user vs casual user - affects prioritization

**Medium priority** (valuable but not urgent):
4. Team growth journey
5. Pre-registration evaluation
6. Mobile and cross-device

**Low priority** (nice to have):
7. Re-engagement and renewal
8. Reporting and analytics
9. Domain-specific variations
10. Collaboration depth (already well-represented, but could go deeper)
