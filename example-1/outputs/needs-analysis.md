### By User Journey Stage

Current distribution (including assigned and empty):
- **onboarding**: 9 needs (explicit assignments)
- **registration**: 3 needs
- **offboarding**: 4 needs
- **setup**: 1 need

*The majority of needs appear to be "daily use" activities that span the active usage phase.*

### By User Type

- **[[user]]**: 71 needs (95%)
  - Covers full spectrum from registration to offboarding
  - Includes both basic and power user needs

- **[[admin]]**: 3 needs (4%)
  - Workspace membership management
  - Role and permission assignment
  - Team setup

- **switcher** (user subtype): 1 need
  - Import existing data
  *Note: This is actually a "user" with attribute "transitioning from another system" - could be reconsidered*

## Patterns Identified

### Common Outcome Themes

**Efficiency outcomes** (13 occurrences):
- "I can work more efficiently" (2 exact matches)
- "without tedious individual actions"
- "accomplish task efficiently"
- "quickly" / "without friction"
- "focus on high-value activities"
- "build on previous work efficiently"

*Recommendation: Standardize to 2-3 outcome phrasings*
- "I can work more efficiently" (for speed/productivity)
- "I can focus on important work" (for automation/elimination)
- "I can accomplish tasks without friction" (for ease of use)

**Collaboration/coordination** (12 occurrences):
- "work together without conflicts or duplication"
- "coordinate my work with others"
- "know who can see and interact with my work"
- "the right people see it"
- "get input from those outside the team"
- "we have a common place for team work"

*These are reasonably distinct, but could benefit from grouping analysis*

**Trust/confidence** (8 occurrences):
- "I can trust the system with..." (2 variations)
- "mistakes don't have permanent consequences"
- "my data is handled according to my preferences"
- "I meet regulatory requirements"

*Fairly consistent already*

**Understanding/awareness** (11 occurrences):
- "understand what changed"
- "understand recent activity"
- "know what requires my attention"
- "make informed decision"
- "set appropriate expectations"

*Could standardize "understand" vs "know" usage*

### Structural Patterns

**"Who is" field quality**: Good separation between role and attribute
- Examples doing it well:
  - "as a: team member / who is: needing someone's input"
  - "as a: admin / who is: managing a team"
  - "as a: user / who is: transitioning from another system"

**Theme usage**: Themes are being used effectively to show conceptual patterns
- Some strong thematic threads:
  - "automation" (templates → rules → triggers → scheduling)
  - "access control" (visibility, permissions, roles)
  - "batch editing" / "bulk operations"
  - "onboarding" cluster (flow, support, migration)

### Potential Duplicates or Overlaps

**1. "see who is working on what" vs "coordinate with team members"**
- see who is working on what.md (ID: 167)
  - Need: see who is working on what
  - Outcome: I can coordinate my work with others
- coordinate with team members.md (ID: 168)
  - Need: coordinate with team members
  - Outcome: we can work together without conflicts or duplication

*Analysis*: These are related but distinct - first is about awareness, second is about coordination mechanisms. **Keep separate.**

**2. "know what others can do with my data" vs "understand who has access"**
- know what others can do with my data.md (ID: 136)
  - Need: know what others can see and do with my data
  - Outcome: I can collaborate safely
- understand who has access.md (ID: 135)
  - Need: understand who else has access
  - Outcome: I know who can see and interact with my work

*Analysis*: First is about permissions/capabilities, second is about visibility into access. Very similar outcomes. **Consider merging** into "understand who has access and what they can do."

**3. "automate repetitive tasks" vs automation category**
- automate repetitive tasks.md (ID: 143, category: performance)
- Three needs in automation category: templates, rules, triggers, scheduling

*Analysis*: "automate repetitive tasks" is a general need; others are specific mechanisms. **Keep separate** but verify categorization - should "automate repetitive tasks" be in "automation" category instead of "performance"?

**4. Bulk operations cluster**
- All 6 bulk operation needs are distinct and form a logical workflow:
  1. select multiple items
  2. filter items before bulk actions
  3. apply changes to multiple items
  4. move or organize items in bulk
  5. delete multiple items safely
  6. undo bulk operations

*Analysis*: **Keep all separate** - they form a coherent workflow.

### Needs That May Be Too Broad

**1. "understand how to use the system"** (ID: 104)
- Very broad - might encompass many specific learning needs
- Could be broken into: navigation, features, workflows
- *Action*: Consider if this is a parent category or a specific need about general tutorials

**2. "automate repetitive tasks"** (ID: 143)
- General need that encompasses templates, rules, triggers
- *Action*: Keep as is - represents the general need that specific automation features address

**3. "adapt workflows to my needs"** (ID: 138)
- Could mean many things: reordering, hiding, customizing
- *Action*: Keep as is - it's about workflow customization capability

### Singleton Categories (Requiring Validation)

**orientation** (1 need)
- "understand what I can accomplish"
- *Recommendation*: Recategorize as "discovery" or create "capability discovery" theme

## Gaps Identified

### Journey Stage Gaps

**Missing journey stages for 50+ needs**: Most "daily use" needs don't have explicit journey stage assignments.

*Recommendation*: Assign journey stages systematically:
- Core actions (CRUD) → "daily use"
- Collaboration features → "daily use"
- Personalization → "customization"
- Automation features → "optimization"
- Discovery/learning → stage-dependent (could be onboarding or daily use)

### User Type Gaps

**Limited admin needs** (only 3): Current admin needs focus on team setup and permissions. Missing admin needs might include:
- Monitor team usage
- Manage billing/subscription
- View team analytics
- Handle team data backup
- Manage integrations
- Set organizational policies

**No power user segmentation**: All regular users lumped together. Consider differentiating:
- Occasional user
- Regular user
- Power user
- Creator vs consumer

### Content Gaps

**Missing need categories**:
- **Integration/API**: Connect to other tools
- **Mobile/cross-device**: Access from different devices, sync state
- **Reporting**: Generate reports, extract insights
- **Compliance**: Beyond audit trail - retention policies, data governance
- **Onboarding others**: Help teammates get started (distinct from admin setup)

**Underrepresented stages**:
- **Exploration/trial**: Only 1 pre-registration need
- **Growth/expansion**: Moving from individual to team use
- **Renewal/retention**: Re-engagement after period of inactivity

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Assign journey stages to remaining 50 needs**
   - Use category and "who is" field to infer appropriate stage
   - Default most operational needs to "daily use"
   - Move personalization to "customization"

2. **Merge potential duplicate**
   - Consider merging "know what others can do with my data" + "understand who has access" → "understand access and permissions"

3. **Recategorize singleton**
   - Move "orientation" need to "discovery" category

4. **Fix category mismatch**
   - Move "automate repetitive tasks" (ID: 143) from "performance" to "automation"

5. **Standardize efficiency outcomes**
   - Update the 2 "I can work more efficiently" variations to be consistent
   - Consider if other efficiency-related outcomes should align

### Research Priorities

**High priority research areas**:
1. **Admin workflows**: Understand full spectrum of admin needs beyond initial setup
2. **Pre-adoption exploration**: How do prospects evaluate before committing?
3. **Team growth journey**: How do solo users transition to team usage?
4. **Integration needs**: What external tools need to connect?
5. **Mobile/cross-device usage**: How do users work across contexts?

**User segments needing research**:
- Admin users (current sample: 3 needs)
- Power users vs occasional users
- Team creators vs team members
- Domain-specific user types

### Process Recommendations

1. **Create need hierarchy**: Consider parent/child relationships
   - Example: "collaborate effectively" → share, coordinate, communicate

2. **Validate themes across categories**: Some themes span multiple categories effectively
   - "automation" theme appears in automation, performance, bulk operations
   - Consider if themes should drive category reorganization

3. **Journey stage refinement**: Current stages mix phases (onboarding, offboarding) with activities (daily use, customization). Consider:
   - Time-based stages: awareness → adoption → active use → expansion → renewal
   - Activity-based modes: learning, doing, optimizing, collaborating

4. **Outcome clustering**: Group needs by shared outcomes to identify:
   - Which outcomes matter most (high-value targets)
   - Which needs enable the same outcome (solution flexibility)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete journey stage assignments for all needs
2. ✅ Apply immediate action recommendations (merges, recategorizations)
3. ⏳ Create research questions document for identified gaps
4. ⏳ Develop hypothesis for admin user needs
5. ⏳ Review and potentially restructure journey stages
6. ⏳ Create outcome-based clustering analysis
7. ⏳ Set up needs/archived/ directory for merged duplicates
